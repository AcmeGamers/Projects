        In software development and product management, a user story is an
        informal, natural language description of one or more features of a
        software system. User stories are often written from the perspective of
        an end user or user of a system. They are often recorded on index cards,
        on Post-it notes, or digitally in project management software. Depending
        on the project, user stories may be written by various stakeholders
        including clients, users, managers, or development team members.

                Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story
                creation:<br />
                ◕ The Card (or often a post-it note) is a tangible physical
                token to hold the concepts.<br /><br />
                ◕ The Conversation is between the stakeholders (customers,
                users, developers, testers, etc.). It is verbal and often
                supplemented by documentation.<br /><br />
                ◕ The Confirmation ensures that the objectives of the
                conversation have been reached.

                The XP team at Connextra in London devised the user story format
                and shared examples with others.

                Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user stories beyond the
                usage of cards in his book User Stories Applied: For Agile
                Software Development that is now considered the standard
                reference for the topic according to Martin Fowler. Cohn names
                Rachel Davies as the inventor of user stories. While Davies was
                a team member at Connextra she credits the team as a whole with
                the invention.

                After a first article in 2005 and a blog post in 2008, in 2014
                Jeff Patton published the user-story mapping technique, which
                intends to improve with a systematic approach the identification
                of user stories and to structure the stories to give better
                visibility to their interdependence.
