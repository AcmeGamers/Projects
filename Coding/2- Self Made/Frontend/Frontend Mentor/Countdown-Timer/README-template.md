## Overview

So here's a small overiew of what you guys might need to do if you ever wanna build this app ~ Acme

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second
- Bonus: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

### Screenshot

Here's a screenshot of my solution, and if you ever wanna add your own in your own repo, the easiest way to do this is to use a browser to view your project, and use your snipping tool to capture the image.

Normally I would use [Lightshot](https://app.prntscr.com/) or [Sharex](https://getsharex.com/) to take the screenshot with a hot-key. They both are free so you don't need to pay for them.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I believe in practice being a main part of learning process, and repeatingly used previous concepts allows people to be more productive and faster. With this exercise, I was able to put a better refresher to my :before and :after pseudo-elements.
